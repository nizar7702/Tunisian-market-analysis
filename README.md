# Project Description
This project aims to analyze the behavior of stock prices using clustering, an unsupervised learning method.
Clustering allows for grouping stocks with similar behaviors, thereby facilitating the identification of common trends and the optimization of investment strategies.
We used the variables "High" (highest price), "Low" (lowest price), and "Close" (closing price) to perform this analysis.
